## Disclaimer
This project is presented as a research and methodology demonstration for logistics prediction systems.

The experiments use the LaDe (Last-mile Delivery) dataset, which is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0 and is used strictly for non-commercial, educational, and research purposes with proper attribution to the original authors.

The purpose of this project is to showcase machine learning methodology, system design, and modeling approaches.

For real-world or commercial deployment, the same pipeline can be applied to client-owned or proprietary logistics data.

## Short Version 

This project demonstrates a logistics prediction methodology using a public research dataset (LaDe, CC BY-NC 4.0). The approach is transferable to proprietary logistics data for commercial applications.
